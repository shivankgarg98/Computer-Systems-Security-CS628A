In this Buffer overflow attack, I have to call the <_Z15execute_commandPKc> which has the system call to get the flag. This address has to be overwritten in the addresses. But the problem in this is, It is virtual pointer and it has to be overwritten in the manner the other vtables are called. So, we overwrite the address of pointer we have in control and the write the addresses by the _Z15execute_commandPKc. This ensures vtable rules are followed. null caharacter is to be added after 'y'.
