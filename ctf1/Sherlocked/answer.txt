Looking at the python script, I figured the method of encryption and reversed it to decrypt the flag. This technique is called block cipher. Also, it is of type  cs628a{}. First, reverse the format string("%02x"%x) to get the cipher text. Since the inverse of XOR is XOR, so XOR the CS628a{} with the enc text to get the key. since placement of letters is not changed. Once we got the key decrypt the whole cipher and convert back.
