In this question,I figured out the attack is format_string. I tried to break the encryption but didn't succeed. So, I resorted to brute force method of finding the character I need to write so they write the desired output to get me to 'get_Flag' function. I succedded to get to the get_Flag in gdb, but the flag does not show up when I run it on bash, instaed encrypted text is shown. I was unable to figure out the mistake from my end in this problem.
