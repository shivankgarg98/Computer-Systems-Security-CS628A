I first used the `strings` to examine the strings in the file. This gives a hint of `ls -l`. Also used objdump & gdb to examine the functions. After that I gave a payload "stuvwxyz1234567890a" to execute `ls -l` to list the directories/files. Now it was the time to exploit the environment varible attack since exact location of ls is  not given. So, I changed the PATH variable to make current working directory of highest priority, and wrote a script named `ls` to execute `cat flag.txt`.
